# Calculator Application

## Overview

The Calculator Application is a simple Python-based calculator that provides basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. It offers a user-friendly graphical user interface (GUI) for performing mathematical calculations.

## Features

- **User-Friendly Interface:** The calculator features a clean and intuitive interface, making it easy for users to input and evaluate mathematical expressions.
- **Basic Arithmetic Operations:** Users can perform addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division operations with ease.
- **Immediate Evaluation:** The calculator provides immediate evaluation of expressions when the "Equals" button is pressed.
- **Clear Function:** Users can clear the input field and start a new calculation with a single click on the "Clear" button.

## Implementation

The Calculator Application is implemented in Python, utilizing the `tkinter` library for creating the GUI components. It includes the following components:

- **Entry Field:** The input field where users can enter mathematical expressions.
- **Buttons:** Buttons for digits 0-9, decimal point, and arithmetic operations (+, -, \*, /), as well as "Equals" and "Clear" buttons.
- **Functions:** The application includes functions for evaluating expressions, appending characters to the input field, and clearing the input field.

To run the application: 1. Save the script to a `.py` file. 2. Open a terminal or command prompt. 3. Navigate to the directory containing the script. 4. Run the script using the command: `python calculator.py`.

The calculator will appear on the screen, and you can start performing calculations.

## Future Enhancements

- **Memory Functions:** Add support for memory functions (e.g., M+, M-, MR) to store and recall results.
- **Scientific Calculator:** Enhance the calculator with scientific functions such as trigonometry, logarithms, and exponentiation.
- **History Log:** Implement a history log to keep track of previous calculations.

## Previews
